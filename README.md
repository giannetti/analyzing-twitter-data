# Analyzing Twitter Data

This repository contains the handout and code examples for the workshop "Analyzing Social Media Data in R."

This workshop is the second in a two-part series on social media data. Twitter data provide researchers with a real-time view into a wide variety of social and cultural topics. In this workshop, we’ll receive a gentle introduction to the R language and RStudio, the most commonly used integrated development environment for R. We’ll explore two social media datasets using some popular packages of the tidyverse collection, including dplyr and ggplot2.
